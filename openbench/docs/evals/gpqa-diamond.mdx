## Overview

GPQA Diamond is a challenging benchmark consisting of graduate-level multiple-choice questions in biology, chemistry, and physics. These questions are specifically designed to be "Google-proof" - meaning they cannot be easily solved by searching the internet or using simple lookup methods. The benchmark tests deep scientific understanding and reasoning capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Graduate-Level Difficulty**: Questions require advanced scientific knowledge typically found at the graduate level
- **Google-Proof Design**: Questions are crafted to resist simple web search solutions
- **Scientific Domains**: Focuses on three core sciences: biology, chemistry, and physics
- **Multiple Choice Format**: Standardized format with carefully crafted distractors
- **Expert Validation**: Questions are validated by domain experts for accuracy and difficulty


## Usage

Run GPQA Diamond evaluation with:

```bash
bench eval gpqa_diamond
```

## Scoring

GPQA Diamond uses accuracy as the primary metric, measuring the percentage of questions answered correctly. Given the graduate-level difficulty and Google-proof nature of the questions, even small improvements in accuracy represent significant advances in scientific reasoning capability.

## Dataset Information

- **Question Count**: 448 carefully curated questions
- **Scientific Domains**: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics
- **Question Categories**: 
  - **Biology** - Molecular biology, genetics, physiology, ecology, and evolution
  - **Chemistry** - Organic, physical, inorganic, and analytical chemistry  
  - **Physics** - Quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and particle physics
- **Format**: Multiple choice with carefully crafted distractors
- **Validation**: Expert-reviewed for accuracy and appropriate difficulty level

## What Makes It "Google-Proof"

GPQA Diamond questions are designed with several characteristics that make them resistant to simple search strategies:

1. **Novel Problem Formulations**: Questions present scenarios that don't have direct matches in online resources
2. **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Solutions require combining multiple concepts rather than single fact lookup
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Questions require deep understanding of scientific principles, not just memorization
4. **Careful Distractors**: Wrong answers are plausible and require genuine understanding to eliminate
