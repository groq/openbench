## Summary

This PR adds the **Breakpoint** code repair benchmark to OpenBench, a comprehensive system-level reasoning benchmark for evaluating models' ability to reconstruct deleted functions and fix subtle bugs in real Python/Pytest repositories.

Based on the paper "Breakpoint: Where Are Good Program-Level Datasets?" ([arXiv:2506.00172](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00172)) and the [original implementation](https://github.com/Uzay-G/breakpoint).

## What are you adding?

- [x] New benchmark/evaluation
- [x] CLI enhancement (group summary fixes)

## Changes Made

### New Benchmark Implementation
- **Added Breakpoint benchmark** with two evaluation modes:
  - `breakpoint_remove` (498 problems): Reconstruct deleted function bodies
  - `breakpoint_discovery` (269 problems): Locate and fix subtle bugs
- **Created eval group** `breakpoint` for running both modes together
- **Implemented AST-based code manipulation** for precise function replacement
- **Integrated pytest JSON reporting** for test execution and failure analysis
- **Normalized scoring formula**: `score = 1 - min(current_failures / baseline_failures, 1)`

### Core Components
- `evals/breakpoint.py`: Task definitions for both evaluation modes
- `solvers/breakpoint_solver.py`: Function code extraction from model completions
- `scorers/breakpoint_scorer.py`: Test execution, failure analysis, and normalized scoring
- `utils/breakpoint_utils.py`: AST manipulation, pytest parsing, and repository setup utilities

### Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- **Fixed method name parsing**: Handle class-prefixed method names (e.g., `"Checker.checkDeadScopes"`)
- **Fixed group summary display**: Support task names with module prefix (e.g., `"openbench/breakpoint_remove"`)
- **Enhanced group summary aggregation**: Support continuous scores (0.0-1.0) in addition to binary (0/1)
- **Improved display formatting**: Show fractional values when appropriate for continuous scores

### Technical Details
- Loads datasets from HuggingFace: [uzpg/breakpoint](https://huggingface.co/datasets/uzpg/breakpoint)
- Clones repositories at specific commits, sets up venvs, installs dependencies
- Executes tests with `pytest --report-log` for detailed failure information
- Handles execution errors (syntax, imports) and test failures gracefully
- Provides detailed failure messages for debugging

## Testing

- [x] I have run pre-commit hooks (`pre-commit run --all-files`)
- [x] Tested breakpoint_remove with 111 samples - achieved 11% average score (expected for this difficulty)
- [x] Tested breakpoint_discovery mode
- [x] Verified eval group displays aggregate summary correctly
- [x] Verified continuous score aggregation with sample data
- [x] Confirmed backward compatibility with existing binary-score benchmarks

### Test Results
From verification runs:
- **Scoring formula verified**: Sample with 127→1 baseline→current failures produces score=0.992 ✓
- **Top performers**: 9/111 samples achieving 0.9+ scores (99%+ test pass rate)
- **Method name parsing**: 0 samples with "Function not found" errors after fix
- **Pipeline components**: All working (git, venv, pytest, parsing, scoring)
- **Average score**: 11.07% across 111 samples (within expected range for benchmark difficulty)
- **Group summary**: Correctly displays aggregate accuracy for both continuous and binary scores

## Additional Context

### Benchmark Characteristics
- **Difficulty**: System-level reasoning - requires understanding entire codebases
- **Dataset size**: 767 total problems (498 remove + 269 discovery)
- **Languages**: Python with Pytest
- **Repositories**: Real open-source projects (beartype, httpie, keras, etc.)
- **Evaluation time**: ~60-120s per sample (includes git clone, venv setup, test execution)

### Performance Notes
From the original paper, GPT-4 achieves ~15-20% average score on remove mode. Our implementation shows similar performance characteristics:
- Average score: 11.07% (testing with various models)
- Non-zero success rate: 17.1% of samples show improvement
- Perfect solve rate: 0% on test run (but 8.1% achieve 0.9+ scores)

This indicates the benchmark is working correctly and provides appropriate difficulty for evaluating code repair capabilities.

### Future Improvements
- F-string escaping optimization (affects ~3-5% of samples, currently handled gracefully)
- Enhanced prompts with more repository context
- Function signature hints in prompts
