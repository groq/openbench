OpenBench provides standardized, reproducible benchmarking for LLMs across 20+ evaluation suites (and growing) spanning knowledge, math, reasoning, reading comprehension, health, long-context recall, and first-class support for your own local evals to preserve privacy. **Works with any model provider** - Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, AWS Bedrock, Azure, local models via Ollama, and more.

## üöß Alpha Release

We're building in public! This is an alpha release - expect rapid iteration. The first stable release is coming soon.

## Features

- **üéØ 30+ Benchmarks**: MMLU, GPQA, HumanEval, SimpleQA, and competition math (AIME, HMMT)
- **üîß Simple CLI**: `bench list`, `bench describe`, `bench eval`
- **üèóÔ∏è Built on inspect-ai**: Industry-standard evaluation framework
- **üìä Extensible**: Easy to add new benchmarks and metrics
- **ü§ñ Provider-agnostic**: Works with 15+ model providers out of the box
- **üõ†Ô∏è Local Eval Support**: Privatized benchmarks can now be run with `bench eval <path>`

## üèÉ Speedrun: Evaluate a Model in 60 Seconds

**Prerequisite**: [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment and install OpenBench (30 seconds)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install openbench

# Set your API key (any provider!)
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key  # or OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.

# Run your first eval (30 seconds)
bench eval mmlu --model groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile --limit 10

# That's it! üéâ Check results in ./logs/ or view them in an interactive UI:
bench view
```

## Building Your Own Evals

OpenBench is built on [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/). To create custom evaluations, check out their excellent [documentation](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/). Once you do build your own private evaluations with Inspect AI that you don't want to open-source, you can point OpenBench  at them with `bench eval <path>` to run!

## Exporting Logs to Hugging Face

OpenBench can export logs to a Hugging Face Hub dataset. This is useful if you want to share your results with the community or use them for further analysis.

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>

bench eval mmlu --model groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile --limit 10 --hub-repo <your-username>/openbench-logs 
```

This will export the logs to a Hugging Face Hub dataset with the name `openbench-logs`.

## FAQ

### How does OpenBench differ from Inspect AI?

OpenBench provides:
- **Reference implementations** of 20+ major benchmarks with consistent interfaces
- **Shared utilities** for common patterns (math scoring, multi-language support, etc.)
- **Curated scorers** that work across different eval types
- **CLI tooling** optimized for running standardized benchmarks

Think of it as a benchmark library built on Inspect's excellent foundation.

### Why not just use Inspect AI, lm-evaluation-harness, or lighteval?

Different tools for different needs! OpenBench focuses on:

- **Shared components**: Common scorers, solvers, and datasets across benchmarks reduce code duplication
- **Clean implementations**: Each eval is written for readability and reliability
- **Developer experience**: Simple CLI, consistent patterns, easy to extend

We built OpenBench because we needed evaluation code that was easy to understand, modify, and trust. It's a curated set of benchmarks built on Inspect AI's excellent foundation.

### How can I run `bench` outside of the `uv` environment?

If you want `bench` to be available outside of `uv`, you can run the following command:

```bash
uv run pip install -e .
```

### I'm running into an issue when downloading a dataset from HuggingFace - how do I fix it?

Some evaluations may require logging into HuggingFace to download the dataset. If `bench` prompts you to do so, or throws "gated" errors,
defining the environment variable

```bash
HF_TOKEN="<HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>"
```

should fix the issue. The full HuggingFace documentation can be found [on the HuggingFace docs on Authentication](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/datasets-polars-auth).


## Development

For development work, you'll need to clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/groq/openbench.git
cd openbench

# Setup with UV
uv venv && uv sync --dev
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please open issues and PRs at [github.com/groq/openbench](https://github.com/groq/openbench).


## Reproducibility Statement
As the authors of OpenBench, we strive to implement this tool's evaluations as faithfully as possible with respect to the original benchmarks themselves.

However, it is expected that developers may observe numerical discrepancies between OpenBench's scores and the reported scores from other sources.

These numerical differences can be attributed to many reasons, including (but not limited to) minor variations in the model prompts, different model quantization or inference approaches, and repurposing benchmarks to be compatible with the packages used to develop OpenBench.

As a result, OpenBench results are meant to be compared with OpenBench results, not as a universal one-to-one comparison with every external result. For meaningful comparisons, ensure you are using the same version of OpenBench.

We encourage developers to identify areas of improvement and we welcome open source contributions to OpenBench.
