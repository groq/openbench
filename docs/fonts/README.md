# Neue Regrade font

This folder is where the Neue Regrade font file should live for your docs.

Expected filename (used by style.css and docs.json):

- `NeueRegrade-Variable.ttf`

Drop the variable TTF here. The site will load the font automatically via
`style.css` and the `fonts` section in `docs.json`.

If the file is missing, the site will gracefully fall back to system fonts.
