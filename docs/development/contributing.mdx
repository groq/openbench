Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenBench!
This guide covers everything you need to know to contribute effectively.

### Key Development Tools

**uv**: Package manager - use uv add "package>=version" for dependencies  
**ruff**: Linting and formatting  
**mypy**: Type checking - required for all new code  
**pre-commit**: Automated code quality checks - must pass before commits
**pytest**: Testing framework with integration test markers

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openbench.git
cd openbench

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lelouvincx/openbench.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment with UV
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
uv sync --dev

# CRITICAL: Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run tests to verify setup
pytest
```

### 3. Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Make Your Changes

### Core Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Single Responsibility">
    - Focus on one feature, bug fix, or improvement per pull request
    - Makes code review easier and reduces merge conflicts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clear Separation of Concerns (SoC)">
    - Keep functions small and focused
    - Separate business logic from presentation logic
    - Use clear interfaces between components
    - Avoid tight coupling between modules
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Documentation and Readability">
    - Use type hints for clarity and validation
    - Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
    - Use descriptive variable and function names
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Standardized Structure">
    - Follow PEP 8 with a line length of 88 characters
    - Mirror OpenBench/InspectAI conventions
    - Use consistent formatting and naming patterns
    - Maintain consistency with existing codebase
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Testing

Write unit tests for all new functionality. Aim for high test coverage including edge cases and error conditions.

```python   tests/test_my_feature.py
import pytest
from openbench.my_module import my_function

def test_my_function():
    """Test my_function with valid input"""
    result = my_function("input")
    assert result == "expected"

def test_my_function_edge_case():
    """Test my_function with edge case"""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        my_function(None)
```

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_my_feature.py
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Individual checks
ruff check .          # Linting
ruff format .         # Formatting
mypy .               # Type checking
```

## Submitting Changes

### Commits

Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) structure:
