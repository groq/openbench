The `bench cache` command helps manage OpenBench's caches, particularly for LiveMCPBench. It provides tools to inspect, list, and clear cached data stored under `~/.openbench`.

## Overview

Currently, LiveMCPBench is the primary evaluation that uses caching. It stores:
- Embedding indexes for LiveMCPTool
- Annotated task data
- Other evaluation assets

## Subcommands

### info

Display cache information and storage sizes:

```bash
bench cache info
```

Shows total cache size and breakdown by evaluation or component.

### ls

List cache contents with various viewing options:

```bash
# Basic listing
bench cache ls

# Tree view for hierarchical display
bench cache ls --tree

# List specific subdirectory
bench cache ls --path livemcpbench
```

### clear

Remove cached data with flexible targeting:

```bash
# Clear entire cache (with confirmation)
bench cache clear --all

# Clear specific subdirectory
bench cache clear --path livemcpbench

# Skip confirmation prompt
bench cache clear -y
```

## Cache Location

All cache data is stored under `~/.openbench/` in your home directory. This location is consistent across different evaluations and provides centralized cache management.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Check total cache usage
bench cache info

# Browse LiveMCPBench cache contents
bench cache ls --path livemcpbench --tree

# Clear only LiveMCPBench cache
bench cache clear --path livemcpbench

# Full cache cleanup
bench cache clear --all -y
```
