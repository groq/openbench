The `bench cache` command helps manage OpenBench's caches, particularly for LiveMCPBench. It provides tools to inspect, list, and clear cached data stored under `~/.openbench`.

## Overview

Currently, LiveMCPBench is the primary evaluation that uses caching. It stores:
- Embedding indexes for LiveMCPTool
- Annotated task data
- Other evaluation assets

## Subcommands

### info

Display cache information and storage sizes:

```bash
bench cache info
```

Shows total cache size and breakdown by evaluation or component.

### ls

List cache contents with various viewing options:

```bash

# List all cache contents  
bench cache ls

# List specific cache with tree view
bench cache ls --type livemcpbench --tree
```

### clear

Remove cached data with flexible targeting:

```bash
# Clear specific cache completely
bench cache clear --type livemcpbench

# Clear subdirectory of specific cache
bench cache clear --type livemcpbench --path logs
```

## Cache Location

All cache data is stored under `~/.openbench/` in your home directory. This location is consistent across different evaluations and provides centralized cache management.
