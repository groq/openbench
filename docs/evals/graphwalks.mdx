description: "Multi-hop reasoning on graphs testing both BFS traversal and parent finding capabilities"
---

## Overview

GraphWalks evaluates language models' ability to perform multi-hop reasoning on graph structures. The benchmark tests fundamental graph traversal capabilities including Breadth-First Search (BFS) navigation and parent node identification, challenging models to understand and navigate complex relational structures.

## Key Features

- **Graph Reasoning**: Tests understanding of graph structures and relationships
- **Multi-Hop Navigation**: Requires reasoning across multiple connected nodes
- **Long-Context Processing**: Challenges models with extended relational information
- **Dual Task Types**: Both BFS traversal and parent finding tasks
- **Scalable Complexity**: Graphs of varying sizes and complexity levels


## Usage

Run GraphWalks evaluation with:

```bash
bench eval graphwalks
```

## Scoring

GraphWalks evaluates performance across multiple dimensions:

- **Overall Accuracy**: Success rate across all graph reasoning tasks
- **Task-Specific Scores**: Separate metrics for BFS and parent finding
- **Complexity Breakdown**: Performance by graph size and structure
- **Reasoning Quality**: Assessment of problem-solving methodology and step-by-step logic
- **Scalability Index**: How well performance maintains with increasing complexity

## Dataset Information

- **Task Types**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Parent Finding challenges
- **Graph Structures**: Simple paths, tree structures, cyclic graphs, dense/sparse networks  
- **Scale Variations**: Small (10-50 nodes), medium (50-200 nodes), large (200+ nodes) graphs
- **Generation**: Algorithmically generated graphs ensuring diversity

## Applications

GraphWalks is particularly valuable for evaluating models intended for:

- **Knowledge Graphs** - Semantic reasoning, query processing, link prediction, entity resolution
- **Social Network Analysis** - Relationship mapping, influence tracking, community detection
- **System Architecture** - Dependency analysis, network topology, fault tracing, resource planning
