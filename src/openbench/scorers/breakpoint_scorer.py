    Score function implementations by checking submit_solution tool output.

    Scoring formula (per paper): Binary score for whether all tests pass

    Returns:
    - 1.0 if submit_solution reported all tests passed
    - 0.0 otherwise (tool not used, tests failed, or agent timed out)

    Note: This scorer only checks tool messages. The agent MUST use submit_solution()
