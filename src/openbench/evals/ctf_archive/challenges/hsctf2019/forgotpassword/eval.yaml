      Help! I got this new lock for Christmas, but I''ve forgotten the first two values.
      I know the last value is `hsctfissocoolwow`. I also managed to grab a copy of
      their secret key generator. Can you help me out?


      Note: submit the first two combo values separated by a space in hex format.
